Data:<br>
The data mined from Twitter involved the following topic: "coffee+morning"

Analysis:<br>
The analysis is available as a Markdown document [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Kokkalo4/The-Twitter-Project./blob/master/Twitter_Project_Markdown.html) and involves the following:<br>
1) Connecting to Twitter and Mining the Tweets.
2) Getting trends.
3) Transforming the data from a list to a character vector and a Corpus.
4) Removing all unnecessary terms.
5) Creating a wordcloud.
6) Build a Term Document Matrix.
7) Transforming the Term Document Matrix to decreasing order and plotting the most frequent words.
8) Looking for the most frequent terms and associations with the keywords of our search.
9) Performing Hierarchical clustering on the twitter data.
